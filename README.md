## Home Intelligence

The idea is to build a starter kit for a IoT project based on Netduino.

Several projects were gathered at Internet, a couple versions are provided:

- Home was the initial project
- Home2 is the latest release

Following projects are provided at both versions:

- Web Server
- File Client
- File Server
- Temperature & Humidity
- Infrared

Netduino provides components for customized projects, based on the Cortex-M Micro Processor running the .NET Micro Framework (NETMF) v4.3. Development can be done on both Windows, with Visual Studio, or with Xamarin Studio on Mac OS X. New investors arrived and improvements are expected for this interesting platform.

Have fun!
