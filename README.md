## Home Intelligence

The idea is to build a starter kit for a IoT project based on Netduino.

Several projects were gathered at Internet, a couple versions are provided:

- Home was the initial project
- Home2 is the latest release

Following projects are provided at both versions:

- Web Server
- File Client
- File Server

Netduino is a nice platform, providing components for several customized projects. New investors promises improvements for this interesting platform.

Have fun!
