## Home Intelligence

The idea is to build a starter kit for a IoT project based on Netduino.

Gathering several projects along some time, IÂ´ll try to list the authors below. A couple versions are provided:

- Home was the initial project
- Home2 is the latest release.

Following projects are provided:

- Web Server
- File Client
- File Server

Netduino was a nice platform some years ago providing components for several customized projects. Currently, new investors promises improvements in this interesting platform.

Have fun!
