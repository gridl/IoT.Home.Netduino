##Home Intelligence

###Define your startup in one sentence:

1. hardware basic product type
2. problem it solves
3. ideal customers

###MVP: minimum viable product

Hardware by nature is comprised of “chunky” stages: design, prototype, manufacture, deploy.

1. how difficult is to build prototype?
2. how long will it take?
3. focus on getting it into users' hands ASAP

###Customer discovery

Customer discovery is a way of improving a product’s success by developing a better understanding of the consumers. Talk to customers and learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you.

This stage is important for every startup. You want to do this ground work now so that you can secure as much as you can your product’s success ($$$) once it’s shipped. It also touches on many other facets of building a startup, like growing a mailing list pre-launch, and having access to direct market research. **Once you’re at the beta stage with your prototype, you’ll be very glad to have a pool of consumers who can provide real feedback for final fixes and tweaks**.

The first thing you need to ask **yourself** is whether you are a customer of your company. Are you personally familiar with the problem that your product is fixing? If you weren’t building this product and came across it in a store, would you buy it and use it? This is your ideal square one.
  
- Avoid pitching: Don’t mention your idea, or what your product is today.
- Ask about specifics of their past and present experience, and not generic opinions about how they would act in the future.
- They should be talking (and you should be listening) 90% of the time.
- Deflect compliments: Compliments are fool’s gold. People are simply nice and they don’t want to hurt your feelings.  Compliments are all worthless, until they are validated. Only facts and commitments have worth. 
- Dig beneath ideas: People will ask for features: “Do you do X?” Always follow this by asking why they want this, how they are coping now, why it matters. Deeply understand their motivations. They will reveal their ultimate goal and how important it is to their buying decision.
- Let them show you their mental model of the world. Don’t correct them or dictate how it looks for you. Even if you have an answer to one of their concerns or objectives, let them talk because you are getting valuable insight into how your customer thinks.
- Ask at least one question that can change or invalidate your whole business. This is your “terrifying question”.
- Learn to love bad news.

#####How to know if it’s working

In addition to obvious good signs like pre-selling before building, there are other signs of a good, valuable meeting:  

- Facts. Concrete, specific facts about what they do and why.  
- Commitment. They are demonstrating their seriousness by giving up more time (another meeting), risking reputation (an introduction to someone else), money (pre-sale), or requesting more info (growing mailing list).

#####How to know if it’s NOT working

- If all you come back with are compliments like, “They love our vision”, or “they’re really excited”. These are not facts.
- People are saying “yes” a lot but are not paying or committing in an way
- You weren’t scared of any of the questions you asked.
- The responses you get from 20 conversations are all over the place. This indicates your market segment is too broad and you need to focus on your buyer persona more.

###The cardboard prototype

Delivering something to the user as soon as possible is a valuable move for startups. For hardware, this means not being afraid of presenting an “ugly” prototype. As long as it shows what it can do, it could be made out of cardboard with wires hanging off of it. Entrepreneurs tend to hesitate when it comes to sharing their product while its in development, or default to assuming that they need more polish for fear of causing a bad first impression. This is a critical error. Evolve your product in parallel with real customer feedback.
